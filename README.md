# 👋 Hi, I'm Onyema Adumeta

With over a decade of experience in Azure Data Engineering and Business Analysis, I deliver scalable, cloud-native data solutions that turn raw information into strategic insights. I design and orchestrate data pipelines using Azure Data Factory, Databricks, Spark, Delta Lake, and ADLS, with seamless integration into Snowflake and secure configuration via Azure Key Vault.

My work powers real-time dashboards and predictive analytics by transforming data into clean, query-optimized layers for Power BI. With a strong background in business analysis, I bridge technical execution with strategic goals—ensuring every pipeline aligns with enterprise objectives and drives measurable impact.
